								<h1>First Part</h1>
								<p>JavaScript</p>
								<p>Javascript is a programming language often seen in the internet, all the styles, images, animations and other fun things you see are made mostly here.</p>
								<p>Jquery</p>
								<p>Jquery is a part of JavaScript which implements new things you use almost everytime you browse, such as things that you can change without having to reload the page</p>
								<p>Qualitative Oscar Rios</p>
								<p>For the second term my main approach has been the user. I have been going to different places asking people if they have this problem, all this to narrow further our targeted users. I have also been browsing the internet to find new information about this problem, to compare it and not just stay with our current solution, but to improve our solution by adding more.</p>
								<p>Qualitative Juan Torres</p>
								<p>In this term i have been working mostly on our solution and how to implement it in our page, i have been investigating about the apps, and gathering feedback with my friends about what they like, and what would they improve. I have also been analizing data gathered on the internet by my partner. For examle we learned that most people don´t like alarms, so we are working on a solution to make the more user friendly.</p>
								<p>Project</p>
								<p>Our project is going as well as expected, we have been interviewing people in order to know what they think about it, and we have have 93% of good comments, meaning 28 out of the 30 people we have asked, like it. Our page is looking nicely, we have already gathered all the info we need to add to the page. Our effort has been of 96 out of 100, but our result we would grade it as a solid 100, because our project is very viable and our page does not include extra things that it doesn´t need</p>
								<p>Main Value of our team</p>
								<p>The main value of our team is that we are both excellent 3rd Semester students here at an excelling university, Tecnologico the Monterrey, but even though we are in the same major, we think very differently which helps us complement each other. Both of our member currently have a job, one of us has been working in this area for over 3 years and the other in the buisness area, which allows us to have  different perspective and improve our proyect.</p>
								<h1>Second Part</h1>
								<p>Our User</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Someone who cares about always being in time</li>
									<li>Someone who doesn´t like how their alarm wakes them up</li>
									<li>Someone who has had problems waking up</li>
									<li>Anyone with the desire of improving a part,even if it is little, of their lifestyle</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Proposed Solution</p>
								<p>Our proposed solution is an app that has alarm levels and also checks when you are putting the alarm, that you normally put in the morning(AM), in the afternoon(PM). The levels of the alarm will determine the complexity of the "Snooze" or "Dismiss" of the alarm. Also we want to put "More configurations" which will allow the user to wake up of different ways, like ligthing up the flashligth or gradually increasing the volumne of the alarm. This with the objective that the alarm isn´t a schock in your body allowing you to wake up more pleasantly</p>
								<p>Main Tasks</p>
								<ul>
									<li>To create an alarm with determined level of importance</li>
									<li>Lock your phone and be confident about your alarme waking you up</li>
